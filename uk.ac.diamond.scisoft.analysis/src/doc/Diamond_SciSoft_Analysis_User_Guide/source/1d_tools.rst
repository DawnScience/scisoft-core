Plotting Tools
--------------
The plotting tools have been changed in Dawn compared to the SDA versions.
The new tools are available from a menu in the plotting and have features such as:
- Reuse of tools in a single view
- Ability to move tools to a dedicated view
- Tools work in conjunction, for instance profiles with a mask or fitting on a derivative
